                    This genetic algorithm is looking for a solution to the TSP problem with 131 cities. <br>
                    How does it works ?<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Mutation : </strong>The mutation is only made of swaps. For every individual, we first do a swap to 
                    do at least one mutation. Then for every gene, with a probability p = <em>MutationRate</em>, we swap this gene with another one.<br>
                    A tricky thing is that, the more your solution is good, the more you need to modify details to find new improvements. 
                    That's why a node will be swapped with another one which is at most at a distance <em>MutationRange</em>. This distance decreases 
                    exponentially with the generations. And with a probability p = <em>6*MutationRate</em>, the swap is just a swap with any node. As 
                    the MutationRate is also decreasing exponentially, after a few iterations, most of the swaps will use the MutationRange variable.<br>
                    One last thing, we keep the mutant if and only if the mutation provided an improvement.<br>
                    With these methods, the algorithm is pretty fast but can converges to a local optima. By reducing the MutationRange, we forbid new big jumps.<br><br>

                    <strong>Crossover :</strong> The crossover is performed between two individuals. For every individual of the population, we will pick 3 other ones and 
                    make a selection turnament. Then we perform a 2-points crossover. We take a segment of the genome of the winner of the turnament. This will be the beginning 
                    of the genome of the child. Then  we look at the last gene of this sequence, and we complete it by reading the genome of the other parents, starting form the 
                    same gene. Once again, we keep the child if and only if it is better than the parent (not the winner of the turnament).<br><br>

                    <strong>Stop criterion :</strong> As we seen before, this algorithm converges to local optima. Then the stop criterion is 
                    "If we don't find any improvement during 500 generations, stop the evolution".<br><br>

                    <strong>Last precisions :</strong> <br>
                    The initial population has 100 individuals.<br>
                    The distances are stored in an array to avoid useless additional computations.<br>
                    RangeMutation = Math.floor(dimension*Math.exp(-generation/1000))+7;<br>
                    mutationRate = 0.2*Math.exp(-generation/2000)+0.02;<br>
                    The algorithm converges in about 5000 generations and find best score &#60;700, the theoretical best for this example is 564.Check this link : http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/index.html#XQG237<br>
                    The whole algorithm is performed with the JS library p5 !<br>
